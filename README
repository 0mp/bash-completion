INSTALLATION
------------

If you are installing the source file manually as opposed to using a packaging
system such as dpkg or rpm, put it somewhere on your system and source it from
either /etc/bashrc or ~/.bashrc.

Here's one possible way of doing that from /etc/bashrc:

bash=${BASH_VERSION%.*}; bmajor=${bash%.*}; bminor=${bash#*.}
if [ "$PS1" ] && [ $bmajor -eq 2 ] && [ $bminor '>' 04 ] \
   && [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then # interactive shell
        # Source completion code
        . /etc/bash_completion
fi
unset bash bmajor bminor

This code checks that the version of bash that is parsing the code is later
than 2.04 and, if so, sources the bash completion code.

While this code may, at first, seem overly complex, the advantage of using it
is that it will also parse correctly when interpreted by bash 1.x. If you have
bash 1.x and bash 2.x users on your system, you must avoid using constructs
that were not valid under 1.x syntax.

If you are putting the bash completion source file somewhere other than
/etc/bash_completion, you will need to edit the top of the file to make
$BASH_COMPLETION point to the correct location.

The line you need to adjust is this one:

[ -z "$BASH_COMPLETION" ] && declare -r BASH_COMPLETION=/etc/bash_completion


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

If you get errors about 'complete' or 'compgen' not accepting the -g flag,
you are probably running bash 2.05 and should either apply the group completion
patch, download a prepatched bash binary of 2.05, or upgrade to 2.05a or later.

If you get errors about 'complete' not accepting the -o flag, you are probably
running bash 2.04. In this case, you should upgrade to bash 2.05a or later.

Copies of the patches are prepatched versions of bash are available from
my Web site at http://www.caliban.org/bash/
