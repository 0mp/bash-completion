If you are installing the source file manually as opposed to using a packaging
system such as dpkg or rpm, put it somewhere on your system and source it from
either /etc/bashrc or ~/.bashrc.

If you are putting it somewhere other than /etc/bash_completion, you will need
to edit the top of the file to make $BASH_COMPLETION point to the correct
location.

The line you need to adjust is this one:

[ -z "$BASH_COMPLETION" ] && declare -r BASH_COMPLETION=/etc/bash_completion

If you get errors about 'complete' or 'compgen' not accepting the -g flag,
you are probably running bash 2.05 and should either apply the group completion
patch, download a prepatched bash binary of 2.05, or upgrade to 2.05a or later.

If you get errors about 'complete' not accepting the -o flag, you are probably
running bash 2.04. In this case, you should upgrade to bash 2.05a or later.

Copies of the patches are prepatched versions of bash are available from
my Web site at http://www.caliban.org/bash/
